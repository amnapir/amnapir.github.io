In addition to the major projects mentioned above, I have developed many other small projects both as course assignments and as a freelancer. Some examples include:

- A project in .NET technologies, maintaining databases in MySQL using C#
- Implementation of a shared address book using OpenLDAP in an Ubuntu Linux environment
- A Database Project for Hostel Management System
- Car Racing Game using C++
- Software for a School Management System using C++
- Development of personal websites using WordPress, .NET, and C#
- A client-server communication software using Java

...and others.
